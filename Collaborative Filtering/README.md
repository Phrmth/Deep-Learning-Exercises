# Collaborative Filtering

<p> Collaborative filtering is a type of personalized recommendation strategy that identifies the similarities between two sets(example - movies and users or users and products) and provides recommendations. Recommender systems collect user information, mining this data to inform which items to display.
  

  <p> It basically works by creating latent features of each category and a dot product between the feature matrix to get the similarities to perform recommendations, in the simplest terms.
